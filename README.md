# Multi Signature Wallet

## Project Description
A smart contract that allows multiple owners to collectively manage and approve transactions before they are executed on the Ethereum blockchain. It enhances the security and control over funds by requiring multiple confirmations for each transaction.

## Project Vision
To provide a secure, decentralized, and transparent method for managing shared cryptocurrency funds where no single user has full control. Ideal for DAOs, startups, and shared accounts.

## Key Features
- Multiple owner support
- Transaction submission by any owner
- Confirmation and execution only after reaching the required approvals
- Protection against unauthorized fund transfer

## Future Scope
- Add UI dashboard for easier management
- Add revocation of confirmations
- Implement time-lock functionality for delayed execution
- Integration with mobile wallets and notifications
